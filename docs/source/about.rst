dhcpcfp - DHCP fingerprint scanner
==================================


``dhcpcfp`` scans the DHCP client REQUEST packet and creates a report
with the fingerprinting data found, the differences of that data with
``dhcpcanon`` and how to avoid to be fingerprinted through DHCP.

It can be run in the following ways:

From the same machine that sends a DHCP packet
------------------------------------------------

This way it the recommended one for end users.
Without any arguments, it will by default:
1. Obtain a DHCP Request packet scanning in active network interface.
   It will only scan for packets generated from the same interface, therefore
   it can take some time unless the interface is restarted.
2. It will query a database with DHCP fingerprints to try to guess device and/or
   operating system.
   TBD
3. It will generate a report with the datapoints found, the guessed devices/
   operating system and recommendations on DHCP clients less fingerprintable.

A machine that scans for DHCP packets in the local network
-----------------------------------------------------------

__ADVICE__: this is only recommended for demonstration purposes.
It is strongly discouraged to run in a network without informed consent from
other users of the network.

In this way ``dhcpcfp`` will scan for DHCP packets not only generated by the
same machine where it runs, but also from the local network.

TBD

Providing a pcap file
----------------------

In this way ``dhcpcfp`` do not scans the network, but obtain the DHCP packets
from a ``pcap`` file.

TBD

Providing a DHCP fingerprint
------------------------------

Providing a DHCP fingerprint (Parameter Request List option) and/or DHCP
vendor option obtained running this same program previously or TBD...
